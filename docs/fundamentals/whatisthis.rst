What is Blocker?
****************

"Blocker" takes its name from the software containerization framework called "Docker" which has uterly terraformed modern software design via a novel approach to encapsulation functionality.  As such Blocker shamelessly rips off much of the inovation which Docker spearheaded in the purely abstract space of software design.  Blocker applies these same inovations in the concrete (and messy) domain of physical reality.

"It works on my machine" (Docker) --> "It works in my Nation, economic, and environmental context" (Blocker)

Blocker is a Language
=====================
Broadly, Blocker is a declarative, and fully general *language* to codify human infrastructure.

As such *all* human infrastructure becomes *information technology* and therefore progresses exponentially.

Blocker is Modular
==================
Blocker is meant to decompose higher levels of abstract functionality down to manageable bits.

Blocker is Portable
===================
... both in the literal sense (shippable), and in the abstract (temporally delocalized to any time period or political encumbant)

In the software space, with **Docker**, one of the brilliant facets of a Dockerfile manifest is that it is timeless and decoupled from a particular hardware configuration.

Once a Docker image has been constructed which "works on my computer", it will work on *any* computer which runs docker ... for the rest of eternity.

Similarly in the infrastructure space, a Blocker image (i.e. the Blockerfile manifest file) should be capable of maintaining the same functionality upon instantiation regardless of which peoples or countries manufacture the image, and in which decade.

Blocker is Scalable
===================
Blocker is a codable language, and scales like other languages... from simple widgets (like a family house) to enterprise applications (like a nation).  Furthermore the technological architectural genome is deliberately compatible with that of Docker, and as such, will leverage existing tooling like Kubernetes to scale functionality to global deployments.

P.S.
====
There is no question the scope of Blocker is immense, and indeed in the early stages of development Blocker's success will hinge on **doing less not more**.  If a business entity had invented the general purpose computer, then it should not be that businesses purview **all of the outcomes of modern computer science**... it would be too much.
