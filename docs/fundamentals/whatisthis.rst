What is Blocker?
****************

"Blocker" takes its name from the software containerization framework called "Docker" which has uterly terraformed modern software design via a novel modality of encapsulating functionality.
As such Blocker shamelessly rips off much of the inovation which Docker spearheaded in the purely abstract space of software design.  Blocker applies these same inovations in the concrete (and messy) domain of physical reality.

The scope of Blocker is immense. Broadly, Blocker is an endeavor to codify human infrastructure.

As such *all* human infrastructure becomes and moves with the agility of information technology.

Language
========
Blocker is a codable language, and scales like other languages... from simple widgets (like a family house) to enterprise applications (like a nation)

Modular
=======
Blocker is meant to decompose higher levels of abstract functionality down to manageable bits.

Portable
========
One of the brilliant facets of a Dockerfile manifest is that it is timeless and delocalized to particular hardware configuration.
Once a Docker image has been constructed which "works on my computer", it will work on *any* computer which runs docker ... for the rest of eternity.

Similarly a Blocker image (i.e. the Blockerfile manifest file) should be capable of maintaining the same functionality upon instantiation regardless of which peoples or countries manufacture the image, and in which decade.
