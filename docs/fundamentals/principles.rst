Principles

We discuss here two broad categories of principles:
1) Cultural Principles
2) Functional Principles


Cultural Principles
===================
The cultural principles are the DNA of Blocker's decision making. This is the “true nature” of Blocker.

Radical Truth and Transparency
------------------------------
 
Fail Transparently and extend the learning to others.  Education is a first class concern.

User Focused
------------
The users of Blocker are anybody who is intrigued to be more effective in this world.


Blocker Functional Principles
=============================

Self Sovereign
===============
This is arguably the single most important feat to accomplish, while simultaneously the most susceptible to risk and conflict.
Blocker is **for all people** and by **all people**.  The data produced is decentralized and accessible to those who the user selects.

Privacy
=======


Decentral
---------


Inversion of Ownership
======================
Blocker arose partially out of

Mobility of Lifestyle
=====================
Blocker exists in a similar "alternate lifestyle" space as "Van Life" and will afford people exponentially more freedom in location and context for their lives.

Data Driven (And immutable)
===========================
One of Blocker's core value propositions is the data that are produced by deployments.

Trust and Integrity
===================
Blocker will ultimately be a global and communally run platform.  There are service providers and service receivers making up the "guts" of the fully actualized embodiment of blocker.global   The service providers and recipients must be able to trust in each others degree of competence, grace, and respect.
