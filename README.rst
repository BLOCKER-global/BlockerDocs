Welcome to the Blocker Docs.
*******************************

"Blocker" takes its name from the software containerization framework called "Docker" which has uterly terraformed modern software design by way of a systematic approach to encapsulating functionality.

Much of the inovation pioneered by Docker is actually generalizable to domains beyond just software.

Blocker shamelessly rips off and builds on top of the inovation which Docker spearheaded in the purely abstract space of software design, and applies these inovations in the concrete (and messy) domain of physical reality in specification and actualization of houses, retail, industrial, communities, cities, nations, planets, solar systems, etc.

 Docker solved "It works on my machine"
 Blocker solves "It works in my economic, environmental, and sociopolitical context"
